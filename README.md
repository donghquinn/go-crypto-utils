## What is Crypto Util?
* It's crypto utils written by golang.
* It must be quite bothering creating secure keys, or encoding strings just for test.
    * In my case, I felt lots of bothersome every single moment I had to encode request bodies or fields for API Encryption/Decryption test with base64 and AES / SHA / Etc...
* This is a simple tool for generating keys or encoding strings
